    "This report is worth 10% of the final grade. Please upload a report (one per team) with all code used, visualizations, and text in a rendered Jupyter notebook. Any visualizations that cannot be embedded in the notebook, please provide screenshots of the output. The results should be reproducible using your report. Please carefully describe every assumption and every step in your report.\n",

You are not required to use the same dataset that you used in the past, but you are encouraged. You must identify a classification task from the dataset that contains three or more classes to predict. That is, it cannot be a binary classification; it must be multi-class prediction. "

Detail exactly what the task is and what parties would be interested in the results. How well would your prediction algorithm need to perform to be considered useful by interested parties?\n",
    "[10 points] (mostly the same processes as from lab one) Define and prepare your class variables. Use proper variable representations (int, float, one-hot, etc.). Use pre-processing methods (as needed) for dimensionality reduction, scaling, etc. Remove variables that are not needed/useful for the analysis. Describe the final dataset that is used for classification/regression (include a description of any newly formed variables you created)."

    "[15 points] Choose and explain what metric(s) you will use to evaluate your algorithmâ€™s generalization performance. You should give a detailed argument for why this (these) metric(s) are appropriate on your data. That is, why is the metric appropriate for the task (e.g., in terms of the business case for the task). Please note: rarely is accuracy the best evaluation metric to use. Think deeply about an appropriate measure of performance.\n",
    "[15 points] Choose the method you will use for dividing your data into training and testing (i.e., are you using Stratified 10-fold cross validation? Why?). Explain why your chosen method is appropriate or use more than one method as appropriate. For example, if you are using time series data then you should be using continuous training and testing sets across time. Convince me that your cross validation method is a realistic mirroring of how an algorithm would be used in practice. \n",
    "Important: You should use your chosen evaluation criteria and chosen method for dividing train/test data throughout the report. For example, arguing that f-score is the best evaluation method, but then using accuracy in a grid search will be regarded as a conceptual error and graded accordingly. "
